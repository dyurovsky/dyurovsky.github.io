Does this communicative pressure on caregivers lead them to structure children's linguistic input in a way that facilitates learning? As a case study, we analyze a canonical pedagogical behavior in caregivers: use of ostensive labeling to teach children new words. Using a multi-method approach, we show that this pedagogically supportive behavior can emerge from communicative pressure alone, without any explicit pedagogical goals. First, in a corpus study, we show that caregivers communicate by ostensive labeling precisely when children are likely to learn a new word. In an iterated reference game, we experimentally show that this strategy can arise from pressure to communicate successfully with a less knowledgeable partner. Then, we show that speaker behavior in our experiment can be explained by a rational communication model that includes planning, without any explicit teaching goal. Finally, in a series of simulations, we explore the language learning consequences of having a communicatively-motivated caregiver. We show that under many parameterizations, simple learning mechanisms interacting with a communicatively-motivated partner outperform more powerful learning mechanisms. This perspective offers a first step toward a unifying, formal account of both how linguistic input is structured and how children learn from it.","tags":[],"title":"Communicative pressure on caregivers leads to language input that supports children's word learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claire Bergey","Zoe Marshall","Simon DeDeo","Daniel Yurovsky"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1633022474,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633022476,"objectID":"38cabafbf54cdaee62d68260fb610229","permalink":"https://www.danyurovsky.com/publication/bergey-2021-learning-2/","publishdate":"2021-09-30T17:21:14.505484Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bergey-2021-learning-2/","section":"publication","summary":"Over their first years of life, children learn not just the words of their native languages, but how to use them to communicate. Because manual annotation of communicative intent does not scale to large corpora, our understanding of communicative act development is limited to case studies of a few children at a few time points. We present an approach to automatic identification of communicative acts using a Hidden Topic Markov Model, applying it to the CHILDES database. We first describe qualitative changes in parent-child communication over development, and then use our method to demonstrate two large-scale features of communicative development: (1) children develop a parent-like repertoire of our model's communicative acts rapidly, their learning rate peaking around 14 months of age, and (2) this period of steep repertoire change coincides with the highest predictability between parents' acts and children's, suggesting that structured interactions play a role in learning to communicate.","tags":[],"title":"Learning communicative acts in children's conversations: a Hidden Topic Markov Model analysis of the CHILDES corpus","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashley Leung","Alexandra Tunkel","Daniel Yurovsky"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632273358,"objectID":"2bbb48276537dbe248bf0b9c136b1cca","permalink":"https://www.danyurovsky.com/publication/leung-2021-parents/","publishdate":"2021-09-22T01:15:58.296926Z","relpermalink":"/publication/leung-2021-parents/","section":"publication","summary":"Young children learn language at an incredible rate. While children come prepared with powerful statistical learning mechanisms, the statistics they encounter are also prepared for them: children learn from caregivers motivated to communicate with them. How precisely do parents tune their speech to their children's individual language knowledge? To answer this question, we asked parent-child pairs (n=41) to play a reference game in which the parent's goal was to guide their child to select a target animal from a set of three. Parents fine-tuned their referring expressions to their children's knowledge at the lexical level, producing more informative references for animals they thought their children did not know. Further, parents learned about their children's knowledge over the course of the game, and tuned their referring expressions accordingly. Child-directed speech may thus support children's learning not because it is uniformly simplified, but because it is tuned to individual children's language development.","tags":[],"title":"Parents fine-tune their speech to children's vocabulary knowledge","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mika Braginsky","Daniel Yurovsky","Virginia A Marchman","Michael C Frank"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632305362,"objectID":"c095cbf0a728a55caf20c48a87a014d1","permalink":"https://www.danyurovsky.com/publication/braginsky-2019/","publishdate":"2021-09-22T10:09:22.516829Z","relpermalink":"/publication/braginsky-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Why do children learn some words earlier than others? The order in which words are acquired can provide clues about the mechanisms of word learning. In a large-scale corpus analysis, we use parent-report data from over 32,000 children to estimate the acquisition trajectories of around 400 words in each of 10 languages, predicting them on the basis of independently derived properties of the words’ linguistic environment (from corpora) and meaning (from adult judgments). We examine the consistency and variability of these predictors across languages, by lexical category, and over development. The patterning of predictors across languages is quite similar, suggesting similar processes in operation. In contrast, the patterning of predictors across different lexical categories is distinct, in line with theories that posit different factors at play in the acquisition of content words and function words. By leveraging data at a significantly larger scale than previous work, our analyses identify candidate generalizations about the processes underlying word learning across languages.","tags":[],"title":"Consistency and variability in children's word learning across languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Yurovsky"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632253070,"objectID":"871a662de6113b6f9f2b70f37a3e7f99","permalink":"https://www.danyurovsky.com/publication/yurovsky-2018/","publishdate":"2021-09-21T19:37:50.208806Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yurovsky-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Young children learn the meanings of thousands of words by the time they can run down the street. Many efforts to explain this rapid development begin by assuming that the computational-level problem being solved is acquisition. Consequently, work in this line has sought to understand how children infer the meanings of words from cues in the communicative signals of the speakers around them. I will argue, however, that this formulation of the problem is back- wards: the computational problem is communication, and language acquisition provides cues about how to communicate successfully. Under this framing, the natural unit of analysis is not the child, but the parent-child dyad. A necessary consequence of this shift is the realization that the statistical structure of the input to the child is itself dependent on the child. This dependency radically simplifies the computational problem of learning and using language.","tags":[],"title":"A communicative approach to early word learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://www.danyurovsky.com/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
